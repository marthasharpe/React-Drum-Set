# React Drum Set

### A drumset that you can play with the keyboard.

I built this as a React App for the Front End Libraries Certification through freeCodeCamp.  
The soundfiles came from the drum kit I made for Wes Bos's JavaScript30-app course.  
I learned a lot about React lifecycle methods to add event listeners and refs.
